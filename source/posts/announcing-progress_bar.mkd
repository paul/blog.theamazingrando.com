#Annoucing ProgressBar

# ProgressBar

I was working on a script to sync hundreds of thousands of records
between two databases, and wanted a simple way to keep track of
progress. I couldn't find one that was easy to use and did what I
wanted, so I [wrote my own][github]. Not much more introduction needed, how about
a simple example?

    $ cat examples/simple.rb

    require 'progres_bar'
    bar = ProgressBar.new

    100.times do
      sleep 0.1
      bar.increment!
    end

    $ ruby examples/simple.rb
    [#########################                                      ] [ 39/100] [ 39%] [00:04] [00:06] [  9.12/s]
