      <p>One of the best things about Rails, that it gets right over so many other frameworks like React, is its <em>Directory Naming Conventions</em>. You can jump into any Rails app written in the last 15 years and no immediately where to go to start exploring. Where's the routes? Database Models? Controllers and Views? Every app keeps them in the same place, so once you learn it, you can easily transfer that knowledge to another project.</p>

      <p>A good way to look at the advantages of a hypermedia-based API vs an "HTTP-RPC"
style one is to consider the differences between "In-Band" and "Out-of-Band"
information. A hypermedia API focuses on getting as much information in-band as
possible, reducing the burden on clients to deal with changes.</p>

      <p>The other day, I gave a brief talk about our HTTP Library, <a href="http://github.com/paul/resourceful">Resourceful</a>. After a few minutes of going over the features,
it became apparent to me that very few people have taken the time to appreciate the finer points of HTTP. Everyone who
calls themself a web application developer needs to take a few hours to read <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">RFC2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</a>.
Its not very long, and increadibly readable for a spec. Print it out, and read a few sections when you go for your
morning "reading library" break. Unfortunately, a great many people got confused by it, and ended up reimplementing a lot
of http in another layer, and thats how we ended up with SOAP and XML-RPC. There's a good parable about
<a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2009/06/fighting-for-rest-or-tale-of-ice-cream.html">how this all went of the rails for awhile</a>, until some people re-discovered a section in  Roy T. Fielding's

      <p>The adapter API for DataMapper has been in a bit of flux recently. When I submitted
my proposal for a <a href="http://mwrc2009.confreaks.com/14-mar-2009-16-10-writing-adapters-for-datamapper-paul-sadauskas.html">talk at MountainWest</a>, adapters were irritatingly complex to write.
You just needed to know too much about DataMapper's internals to be able to write one.
A week before the conference began, I started a significant effort to re-write the API to make
it easier. I succeeded, a little too well; my 30 minute talk only took 15. Since then,
I've written a couple more adapters from scratch, and refined the API further. This post
will serve as notes on the changes that I've made, and a tutorial on writing adapters.</p>

      <p><a href="http://resourceful.rubyforge.org/">Resourceful</a> is an advanced http library for Ruby that does all the fancy stuff that makes HTTP an amazing protocol. I'm pleased to announce the <a href="http://github.com/paul/resourceful/commits/rel_0.2">initial release</a> of Resourceful, 0.2. It already has some pretty cool features, with more to come.</p>

      <p>I realized I haven't blogged about (IMHO) the neatest feature of DataMapper's migrations yet. One of the more harrowing experiences for me in Rails is upgrading a production server with live data, and hoping your migration handles all the existing data correctly. You can dump the database, and attempt the migration on a clone, and hand-examine the data to make sure it was correct, but that feels very non-ruby-like to me. With the spec groups and matchers available in DataMapper migrations, though, you can spec your migrations and be certain that it will work correctly, and translate all your edge-case data correctly.</p>

      <p>When using a mongrel cluster, you can either log to a separate file for each mongrel instance, or you can log them all to the same file, but on a loaded cluster, there's a good chance your logged lines will get interleaved and be unreadable. Luckily, there's another way. The new replacement for log4r <a href="http://logging.rubyforge.org">Logging</a> can take care of this. It has a built-in way of <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/142485">not interleaving the lines</a>, but (I think) its using lockfiles to do so, and if so, that's going to be detrimental to performance. The best solution has been around for 25 years, syslog. And with one of the more recent syslog daemons (syslog-ng, or rsyslog), you can set it up to log your mongrel log wherever you like.</p>

      <p>I've heard several times that you should avoid exceptions because they are slow. They are in Java, so I think that has given them a bad name everywhere. The only real numbers I could find are from <a href="http://www.notsostupid.com/blog/2006/08/31/the-price-of-a-rescue/" title="http://www.notsostupid.com/blog/2006/08/31/the-price-of-a-rescue/"></a><a href="http://www.notsostupid.com/blog/2006/08/31/the-price-of-a-rescue/">http://www.notsostupid.com/blog/2006/08/31/the-price-of-a-rescue/</a> . His 'plain' test is also missing the conditional that would also have to be executed (In this case, to make sure 5 is not 0). His post is also 18 months old, so I updated the 'plain' test and re-ran it (Upping the runs to 5,000,000). My plain test now looks like:

    <p>
      <p>Comcast user? Bummed that they're ruining your bittorrent? No problem. They way the kill your connection is by sending unsolicited TCP reset packets to your bittorrent client, making it think that the person you're downloading from has closed the connection. If you're using a good firewall/router, you can write a rule that will block it. I'm using <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> firmware for my Linksys WRT54G, and added the following line to my firewall scripts:
<code>
iptables -A {wan interface} -p tcp --dport {bittorrent port} --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP
</code>
This drops all incoming RST packets to your bittorrent client. Now, this even removes the legitimate ones, if your source really does disconnect, you won't know about it. Luckily, the connection will timeout after about 10 minutes anyways, so its not that bad. I've been using this for a couple weeks now, and my bittorrent transfer speeds are back to what they were before Comcast started doing all this.</p>
