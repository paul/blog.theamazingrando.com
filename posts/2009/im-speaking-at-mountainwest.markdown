Title: I'm Speaking at MountainWest!

I'm going to be giving a talk at [Mountain West Ruby Conf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/speakers)!

For those of you too lazy to scroll down and find the details of my talk, I'll repeat them here:

> Some might think of DataMapper as a better, faster, competitor to ActiveRecord. However, they would be missing on of its greatest strengths. At its core, DataMapper provides a uniform interface on top of ANY persistance layer. All thats needed is a simple adapter class that can translate the native persitance into a simple 4-method API for DataMapper to consume. This talk will cover that API, and some best-practices on implementing an adapter. We will explore the YAML Adapter, which I will be writing for the purposes of this talk.

Wish me luck!
