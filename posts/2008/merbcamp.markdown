#Merbcamp

Here's my own personal store of interesting crap I picked up in merbcamp. I'll add to this as the talks go on.

 * carllerche is a pretty cool guy for adding useful stuff to the merb router for me
 * mauth is pretty sweet
 * When can I get a 4K tv in my living room?
 * [FiveRuns tuneup for merb][tuneup-merb]
 * [webrat][] looks to make acceptance specs/stories actually useable
 * Ruby Language book by Matz is a good read for learning the internals of Ruby
